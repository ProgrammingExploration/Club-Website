                This club, you may have noticed if you looked through the courses, does cover tons of concepts and information. For example, if you look at the Web Development Course you learn HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, React JS, Node JS Express NEDB, React Native, TypeScript, and a bit about Angular. And, that is a lot of concepts to learn for one year, but you aren’t going to come out of this club having mastery knowledge on all of these topics, but you will have enough knowledge to make any app, website, game, or automation you want just by a little research. And you might be thinking that isn’t that possible even if I didn’t participate in the club, and my answer would be known. I believe in this theory that I call Barrier to Entry, anything you are trying to learn, you must have the basic knowledge and almost an intermediate level understanding, before you go on your own if you want to learn in the most efficient way possible. And I follow these rules as well. I go through and I find tutorials for all these different concepts while still being a beginner, and after finishing the course, I try building a project with this skill that I just learned, to fine tune my skills and also just to test myself. And, this club takes a perfect tour of all of these topics because in the beginning you learn and cross that barrier to entry, and once you do that, in the end of the club, you get sometime to research and create your own project, and you can enter the project into a competition. Hopefully, by crossing the barrier of entry for this club, you chose to participate in the Programming Exploration.
