                At its heart, Visual Studio Code features a lightning fast source code editor, perfect for day-to-day use. With support for hundreds of languages, VS Code helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, and more. Intuitive keyboard shortcuts, easy customization and community-contributed keyboard shortcut mappings let you navigate your code with ease. For serious coding, you'll often benefit from tools with more code understanding than just blocks of text. Visual Studio Code includes built-in support for IntelliSense code completion, rich semantic code understanding and navigation, and code refactoring.And when the coding gets tough, the tough get debugging. Debugging is often the one feature that developers miss most in a leaner coding experience, so we made it happen. Visual Studio Code includes an interactive debugger, so you can step through source code, inspect variables, view call stacks, and execute commands in the console. VS Code also integrates with build and scripting tools to perform common tasks making everyday workflows faster. VS Code has support for Git so you can work with source control without leaving the editor including viewing pending changes diffs.

                VS Code or Visual Studio Code is a powerful code editor, and the best thing about this tool is that it is completely free. This is a code editor/IDE which is amazing, and several people use it, including me, while building huge projects, building startups, and even employees in google use this product. The reason that so many programmers and developers use this code editor is because you can completely customize it to your needs. Starting from changing the theme color of the editor, to creating shortcuts that paste in boiler plate code for you, VS Code is the most customizable editor out there. We will use this editor in â…˜ of the code editors that we use, and the exception is App Development because there is an even more powerful tool supporting just app development, Android Studio.
