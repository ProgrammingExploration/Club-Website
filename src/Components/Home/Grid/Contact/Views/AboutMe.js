                Hi, I am Om Shivam Panda and I am in 8th Grade. I made this club hoping to give you enough knowledge to actually go off on your own and start developing anything you really want. I was in 4th grade when I started programming and I really did enjoy it and for 4 years I have been exploring and researching new technologies and languages to learn. I have come across almost all software tools and learnt app development, game development, and web development along the way. Over this time I have learnt several languages, skills, and used several tools. I have built software for myself most of the time but I have built a website for a private tutoring business called Lawless Language Arts.
